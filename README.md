# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2020 ðŸŽ„

These are my solutions for [2020's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). I would have liked to do them in Rust, but I don't know Rust yet. So here's some more Ruby, I guess.

To run any of my solutions, you can just run its `main.rb` file with `ruby`. For example, to run my solution for the first day, just run `ruby day-01/main.rb` in your Terminal.
